    "\n",
    "Lucas Primality Test is a primality criteria that shows that in fact, we will only need to test the values of $g^k$ for a few $k$'s, and more precisely for a polynomial number of them.\n",

    "__Certificate:__\n",
    "To produce a certificate of primality for $n$, write down a factorization of $n - 1$ into prime numbers, as well as a witness of primality for $n$. Recursively, add to the certificate, certificates of primality for the prime numbers in the factorization. Stop the recursion at the numbers 2 and 3, which are obviously prime.\n",

    "__Length:__\n",
    "Consider the certificate tree with $n$ as the root, the children of a node $m$ being the prime factors of $m-1$, and having as leaves 2's and 3's. Note that each non leaf node has > 1 children. This implies that the tree, which has $O(\\log n)$ leaves, has $O(\\log n)$ nodes. Each node stands for a number $\\leq n$ and therefore can be represented with $O(\\log n)$ bits. In total we only need $O(\\log^2 n)$ bits to represent this tree. For the $O(\\log n)$ witnesses, one per node, $O(\\log^2 n)$ bits are again sufficient. Therefore the certificate's length is polynomial in $\\log n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Running Time:__\n",
    "For each node, we need to check the factorization of a $O(\\log n)$-bit number. This can be done in $O(\\log^2 n)$ time with the standard multiplication algorithm. Since there are $O(\\log n)$ nodes, we can check all the factorizations in $O(\\log^3 n)$ time. As for witnesses, we need to check $O(\\log n)$ of them, and each check requires a modular exponentiation which can be done in $O(\\log^3 n)$ time. Therefore the total time for verifying witnesses is $O(\\log^4 n)$. In conclusion, the certificate can be verified in polynomial time.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since 2002 (AKS), we know the stronger result that PRIMES is in P. Therefore, the result of this notebook is not as compelling as it used to be. What would be the new \"PRIMES is in coNP\"? It should be a natural problem not known to be in P, and such that the proof that it is in NP is not trivial. This excludes many NP-complete problems such as SAT which are trivially in NP.\n"
