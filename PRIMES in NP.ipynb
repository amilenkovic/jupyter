    "\n",
    "Lucas Primality Test is a primality criteria that shows that in fact, we will only need to test the values of $g^k$ for a few $k$'s, and more precisely for a polynomial number of them.\n",

    "__Certificate__\n",
    "To produce a certificate of primality for $n$, write down a factorization of $n - 1$ into prime numbers, as well as a witness of primality for $n$. Recursively add, to the certificate, certificates of primality for the prime numbers in the factorization. Stop the recursion at the numbers 2 and 3, which are obviously prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Length__\n",
    "Consider the certificate tree with $n$ as the root, the children of a node $m$ being the prime factors of $m-1$, and having as leaves 2's and 3's. Note that each non leaf node has > 1 children. This implies that the tree, which has $O(\\log n)$ leaves, has $O(\\log n)$ nodes. Each node stands for a number $\\leq n$ and therefore can be represented with $O(\\log n)$ bits. In total we only need $O(\\log^2 n)$ bits to represent this tree. For the $O(\\log n)$ witnesses, one per node, $O(\\log^2 n)$ bits are again sufficient. Therefore the certificate's length is polynomial in $\\log n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Running Time__\n",
    "For each node, we need to check the factorization of a $O(\\log n)$-bit number. This can be done in $O(\\log^2 n)$ time with the standard multiplication algorithm. Since there are $O(\\log n)$ nodes, we can check all the factorizations in $O(\\log^3 n)$ time. As for witnesses, we need to check $O(\\log n)$ of them, and each check requires a modular exponentiation which can be done $O(\\log^3 n)$ time. Therefore the total time for verifying witnesses is $O(\\log^4 n)$. In conclusion, the certificate can be verified in polynomial time.\n",
